<b> How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? </b>

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is as simple as talking with the users themselves to create stories of the users experience or what they would desire from a projected experience. The reason this is important is because it captures an important contexual view when building the software as we are able to account for issues that we may have not before given that we are not potential users of the system itself, and may not know the audience and what type of tool they need.

<b> How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? </b>

The way we approach developing programs comes with the overall understanding of the scope of what issue is attempting to be solved. Wether this application is supposed to serve as a function that controls a machine to act a certain way, or offers functions as a tool for different individuals to conduct business online. One agile process I hope to incorporate into my future development work is Scrum, as I think that Scrum is a great tool to be used when communicating with the different audiences pertinent to the development lifecycle of a system.

<b> What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? </b>

I think that being a good team member in software development involves communicating the different processes and understanding the overall processes and procedures needed in the spectrum of developing software. Being prepared and understanding these different aspects of a system helps greatly because we are able to understand exactly what needs to happen to move forward in the case there are any issues understanding how to address an aspect of development.
